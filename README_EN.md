# SprintCycle

[中文](README.md)

**SprintCycle** is a self-evolving contract-driven agile development platform that transforms "natural language requirements" into "traceable software delivery", using `LifecycleContract` to connect the complete closed loop from intent to versioned evolution.

Current Version: **0.9.2** (matches `sprintcycle.__version__`)

---

## Product Definition

### One-sentence Definition

SprintCycle is a self-evolving contract-driven agile development platform — turning "natural language requirements" into "traceable software delivery", with LifecycleContract connecting the complete closed loop from intent to versioned evolution.

### Product Essence

**SprintCycle is NOT:**

- Not a code generator (doesn't write code directly)
- Not a CI/CD tool (doesn't do build/deployment pipelines)
- Not a project management tool (doesn't do kanban or ticketing)

**SprintCycle IS:**

- **Intent-to-delivery closed-loop orchestrator**: Input natural language intent, output versioned deliverables with evidence
- **Contract-driven**: `LifecycleContract` is the single source of truth across the entire pipeline — from requirements to code to testing to deployment, everything revolves around the same contract
- **Self-evolving**: Execute → Observe → Diagnose → Repair → Deliver → Govern → Promote, forming a traceable, replayable, promotable evolution loop

### Core Problems & Solutions

| Problem | SprintCycle Solution |
|---------|---------------------|
| Intent fragmentation: Requirements only exist in chat history, AI doesn't know context, starts from zero each time | `LifecycleContract` is created from the requirement stage, all subsequent phases revolve around the same contract |
| Execution fragmentation: AI writes code but has no evidence chain — don't know what changed, why, or if it's correct | Unified state machine + evidence chain, each stage produces verifiable evidence |
| Evolution fragmentation: No versioned knowledge accumulation, changes are lost after each iteration, cannot build up | Versioned evolution — each promotion writes to version registry |

### Core Concepts

#### LifecycleContract

The single source of truth across the entire pipeline. Created from intent, flows through all stages, and ultimately becomes versioned evolution.

```text
Intent → Contract → Plan → Execute → Observe → Repair → Deliver → Govern → Promote → Evolution
```

#### LifecycleStage

Adopts **Phase-Substage Architecture**, covering the complete closed loop from "new requirement" to "promoted":

**INITIALIZING Phase**:
```text
NEW → NORMALIZED → PLANNED → DECOMPOSED
```

**EXECUTING Phase**:
```text
RUNNING → OBSERVING → DIAGNOSED → REPAIRING → VERIFYING
```

**DELIVERING Phase**:
```text
DELIVERING → RUNTIME_LINKED
```

**GOVERNING Phase**:
```text
GOVERNING → PROMOTION_READY
```

**TERMINAL Phase**:
```text
PROMOTED, FAILED, ABORTED, CANCELLED
```

**Key recovery path**: Failure at any stage → DIAGNOSED → REPAIRING → VERIFYING → OBSERVING → Continue

#### PromotionPolicy

Not all contracts can be promoted. Must meet all criteria:

- Score ≥ 70 (configurable)
- Runtime healthy
- Governance approval passed
- Evidence chain complete (has final_snapshot)
- Repair loop confirmed

### Product Capability Matrix

| Capability | Description | Technical Implementation |
|------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| Intent-driven | Natural language → Structured ReleasePlan | IntentParser + ReleasePlanGenerator |
| Sprint Orchestration | Scrum-based multi-sprint sequential execution | SprintOrchestrator + SprintExecutor |
| Multi-Agent Collaboration | 5 Agent types: Coder/Tester/Architect/Analyzer/RegressionTester | AgentStrategy pattern |
| Checkpoint Resume | Resume from any interrupted stage | StateStore + checkpoint |
| Auto Repair | Execution failure automatically enters diagnose→repair→verify loop | RepairOrchestrationService |
| Governance Checks | Architecture contracts/static analysis/security scanning/mutation testing | pluggy plugin system, 7 built-in plugins |
| HITL Human Approval | Request human confirmation at key decision points | HitlFacade + Coordinator |
| Versioned Evolution | Write to version registry after promotion, supports rollback | EvolutionRequest + VersionStore |
| Observability & Audit | Real-time event stream, trace, replay, health metrics | ObservabilityService + Phoenix integration |
| Skills Subsystem | Scene recognition → skill matching → injection → review | SkillStore + SkillOrchestrator |

### User Journey: A Solo Developer's Day

```text
09:00  sprintcycle run "Add JWT refresh token to user auth module"
        → System creates LifecycleContract
        → Intent normalization → Generates ReleasePlan (2 Sprints)
        
09:02  Sprint 1 begins execution
        → Architect Agent analyzes existing code
        → Coder Agent implements JWT refresh logic
        → Tester Agent generates tests
        
09:15  Execution complete → OBSERVING → Score 82
        → DELIVERING → RUNTIME_LINKED
        
09:16  Governance checks run automatically
        → Architecture layering ✅
        → Static analysis ✅
        → Security scan ⚠️ (1 potential issue found)
        
09:17  Enters GOVERNING → Human approval (HITL)
        → Developer confirms security scan results are acceptable
        
09:18  PROMOTION_READY → PromotionPolicy evaluation → Passed
        → Writes to version registry → v0.3.1
```

### Differentiation from Competitors

| Dimension | Cursor/Copilot | CI/CD (GitHub Actions) | Project Management (Jira/Linear) | SprintCycle |
|-----------|---------------|------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------|
| Focus | Code generation | Build/deployment | Task management | Intent-to-delivery closed loop |
| Context | Current chat window | None | None | LifecycleContract full pipeline |
| Traceability | ❌ Lost when chat disappears | ✅ Build logs | ⚠️ Task status | ✅ Evidence chain + version registry |
| Self-repair | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ diagnose→repair→verify |
| Governance | ❌ | ⚠️ Lint | ❌ | ✅ 7-layer governance + HITL |
| Version Evolution | ❌ | ✅ Git tag | ❌ | ✅ versioned evolution + promotion gates |

**SprintCycle fills the gap** between AI coding and formal delivery.

### Product Positioning

SprintCycle is the agile delivery engine for the AI era.

It's not about making AI write code faster — it's about making every line of code AI writes have a source, have evidence, have governance, and have versioning — forming an evolvable software delivery closed loop from intent to versioned evolution.

### Target Users

- **Solo developers / One-person companies**: Using AI to accelerate development but needing structured delivery processes rather than pure vibe coding
- **AI-assisted development teams**: Needing governance and approval mechanisms to constrain AI-generated code quality
- **Self-evolving system builders**: Needing measurement + evolution loops to continuously improve systems

### Business Model Direction

- **Open Source Core**: SprintCycle framework itself MIT licensed
- **Value-added Services**: Cloud Dashboard / Team Collaboration / Enterprise Governance (future)
- **Ecosystem**: Skills Marketplace / Agent Plugin ecosystem

```

### Core Positioning

SprintCycle is not a single-purpose task runner. It is an end-to-end **intent-driven closed-loop production platform** that keeps one authoritative `LifecycleContract` across the entire flow and uses a unified state machine, recovery path, promotion gate, and version registry to make Dashboard / REST API / Python SDK-initiated work stable and auditable.

### End-to-end Lifecycle

```text
Intent → Normalize → Plan → Prepare → Decompose → Execute → Observe → Diagnose → Repair → Deliver → Link Runtime → Govern → Promote Versioned Evolution
```

### Key Platform Principles

- **Intent-driven**: Start from natural language intent and generate executable plans
- **Unified contract**: `LifecycleContract` is the single source of truth for lifecycle facts
- **Unified state machine**: `LifecycleStateMachine` defines canonical lifecycle stages and transitions (Phase-Substage Architecture)
- **Unified recovery**: any failed stage can route into `repair → verify → observe`
- **Unified final snapshot**: `final_snapshot` captures the complete, promotable end state of an iteration
- **Unified promotion gate**: promotion only accepts evidence-complete contracts with a valid final snapshot
- **Unified versioning**: promoted iterations are stored in the version registry as `versioned evolution`
- **Closed-loop production**: Complete closed loop from intent to usable software
- **Port-Adapters pattern**: Define interfaces in `domain/ports/`, implement in `infrastructure/adapters/`

## DDD Domain-Driven Design Architecture

### Subdomain Partitioning

SprintCycle follows DDD Hexagonal Architecture with subdomain partitioning:

#### Core Domains - Core Competency

| Subdomain | Responsibility | Aggregate Roots | Value Objects |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **lifecycle** | Lifecycle contracts and state machine (Phase-Substage Architecture) | `LifecycleRoot` | `StageEvidence`, `CorrelationContext`, `LifecycleEvidence`, `FailureInfo`, `RuntimeRef`, `GovernanceRef`, `EvolutionRef` |
| **execution** | Execution engine and task orchestration | `SprintAggregate`, `ReleasePlanAggregate` | `TaskResult`, `SprintResult` |
| **evolution** | Version evolution and promotion | `EvolutionRequest`, `SandboxSession` | `VersionArtifact`, `EvolutionEvidence` |
| **governance** | Governance and suggestion handling (includes verification engine) | `GovernanceSession`, `RuleSetAggregate` | `GovernanceRule`, `RuleEvaluation`, `Finding`, `VerificationFinding`, `VerificationRule`, `VerificationReport` |

#### Supporting Domains - Business Support

| Subdomain | Responsibility | Main Modules |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| **intent** | Intent parsing and normalization | `supporting/intent/` |
| **fitness** | Health evaluation | `supporting/fitness/` |

#### Generic Domains - Infrastructure Abstractions

| Subdomain | Responsibility | Main Modules |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| **errors** | Error handling and knowledge routing | `generic/errors/` |
| **prompts** | Prompt management | `generic/prompts/` |
| **models** | Generic data models | `generic/models/` |
| **platform** | Platform views | `generic/platform/` |
| **interfaces** | Generic interface definitions | `generic/interfaces/` |

#### Ports - External Dependency Abstractions

All external dependency interfaces are defined in `domain/ports/` (17 ports):

| Port File | Protocol | Responsibility |
|-----------|----------|---------------|
| `state_store.py` | `StateStoreProtocol` | State persistence |
| `llm.py` | `EngineAdapterProtocol` | LLM engine calls |
| `cache.py` | `CacheBackendProtocol` | Cache services |
| `governance.py` | `ArchGuardAdapterProtocol`, `GrimpAdapterProtocol`, `ImportLinterAdapterProtocol`, `RuffAdapterProtocol`, `TypeCheckAdapterProtocol` | Architecture guard checks |
| `observability.py` | `ObservabilityFacadeProtocol` | Observability integration |
| `registry.py` | `RuntimeRegistryProtocol` | Runtime registration |
| `knowledge.py` | `KnowledgeRepositoryProtocol` | Knowledge management |
| `evolution.py` | `EvolutionRegistryProtocol`, `VersionManifestProtocol` | Version evolution |
| `hitl.py` | `HitlStoreProtocol` | Human-in-the-loop |
| `audit.py` | `AuditPort` | Audit logging |
| `config.py` | `RuntimeConfigProtocol` | Runtime configuration |
| `deploy.py` | `PlatformLaunchServiceProtocol` | Deployment services |
| `rate_limit.py` | `RateLimitPort` | Rate limiting |
| `diagnostics.py` | `DiagnosticPort` | Diagnostics services |
| `integrations.py` | `LangGraphRuntimeAdapterProtocol`, `PhoenixTraceRuntimeProtocol`, etc. | Third-party integrations |
| `suggestion.py` | `SuggestionStoreProtocol` | Suggestion system |
| `orchestration.py` | `RuntimeConfigPort`, `TraceRuntimePort` | Execution orchestration |

### Aggregate Root Design Principles

1. **Immutable Design**: All state modifications return new instances for thread safety
2. **Phase-Substage Architecture**: `LifecycleRoot` adopts phase-substage layered architecture for better organization
3. **Value Objects**: No identity, equality based on attribute values
4. **Event-Driven**: Subdomains communicate via `DomainEvent` for decoupling
5. **ID References**: Cross-aggregate references use IDs instead of direct object references to prevent circular dependencies

### Domain Services

| Service | Responsibility | Location |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| `LifecycleStateMachineService` | State machine transition rules (Phase-Substage Architecture) | `domain/core/lifecycle/services.py` |
| `EventBus` | Event publish/subscribe mechanism | `domain/core/events/handlers.py` |

### Port-Adapters Pattern

```python
# Port definition (domain/ports/)
class StateStoreProtocol(Protocol):
    def save(self, state: ExecutionState) -> None: ...
    def load(self, execution_id: str) -> Optional[ExecutionState]: ...

# Adapter implementation (infrastructure/adapters/)
class SqliteStateStore(StateStoreProtocol):
    def save(self, state: ExecutionState) -> None:
        # SQLite implementation
        ...
```

### Composition Root Pattern

```python
# application/composition/http_factory.py
class InfrastructureFactory:
    """Infrastructure factory registrar - responsible for registering all Domain layer Infrastructure factory functions"""
    
    def _register_infrastructure_factories(self) -> None:
        # Register state store factory
        register_state_store_factory(create_state_store)
        # Register cache factory
        register_cache_backend_factory(create_cache_backend)
        # Register config factory
        register_runtime_config_factory(create_runtime_config)
        # ... more factory registrations
```

## Key Capabilities

### 1. Intent-driven delivery loop
- Describe goals in natural language
- Generate Release Plans (YAML / structured plans)
- Support sprint orchestration, checkpoint resume, and recovery
- Support normalized lifecycle stage transitions (Phase-Substage Architecture)
- **DDD Aggregate Root**: `LifecycleRoot` serves as the lifecycle domain aggregate root with immutable design and Phase-Substage Architecture

### 2. Standard lifecycle contract
- `LifecycleStateMachine` owns the canonical stage transition rules (Phase-Substage Architecture)
- `LifecycleContract` carries cross-service state facts
- A unified correlation model links `execution_id`, `task_id`, `suggestion_id`, `runtime_id`, `version_id`, and `trace_id`
- `final_snapshot` aggregates execution, observation, governance, repair, delivery, runtime, and promotion evidence

### 3. Repair and delivery loop
- Explicitly supports `diagnosed → repairing → verifying → observing`
- Explicitly supports `delivering → runtime_linked → governing → promotion_ready → promoted`
- `RepairOrchestrationService` provides a unified recovery route
- `PromotionPolicy` acts as a promotion gate and blocks incomplete contracts

### 4. Governance and suggestion handling
- Multi-source validation plugin system powered by pluggy
- Architecture contract checks, static analysis, YAML validation, ADR checks, mutation testing, and dependency security scanning
- Suggestion review, approval, rejection, archival, and HITL promotion
- **DDD Aggregate Roots**: `GovernanceSession`, `RuleSetAggregate` manage governance sessions and rule sets
- **Verification Engine**: Integrated into governance subdomain with multiple verification providers

### 5. Observability, audit, and runtime
- Execution events, trace, replay, summary, and health read models
- Observability traces write audit payloads into the lifecycle contract
- Runtime registry and deployment linkage
- `lifecycle_contract(...)` and `evolution_overview(...)` can query final snapshots, active versions, and promotion guards directly

### 6. Versioned evolution
- Successful promotion writes to the SQLite version registry
- Active version pointers are linked to final snapshots
- `EvolutionOverviewResult` shows recent versions, active versions, and final snapshot versions together
- **DDD Aggregate Roots**: `EvolutionRequest`, `SandboxSession` manage version evolution and sandbox sessions

### 7. Dashboard and integrations
- Vue 3 + Element Plus web dashboard
- FastAPI backend
- Dashboard, REST API, and Python SDK share the same core contract entry
- Quality decisions are made explicit through an independent Evaluator Agent and a Sprint Contract

### 8. Skills subsystem
- Scene recognition, skill matching, skill injection, review checklist enrichment, and retro cleanup
- Hooked into the main flow through `SprintOrchestrator` sprint hooks
- **DDD Aggregate Roots**: `SprintAggregate`, `ReleasePlanAggregate` manage execution aggregates

## Python API

The Python API and Dashboard / REST API share the same `SprintCycle` entrypoint. `plan`, `run`, `diagnose`, `status`, `rollback`, and `stop` all align semantically with the REST surface, making it easy to use in scripts, services, and automation pipelines.

```python
from sprintcycle import SprintCycle

api = SprintCycle(project_path="./my-project")
result = await api.run("Refactor the authentication module")
```

**DDD Core Components**:

```python
from sprintcycle.domain.core.lifecycle import (
    LifecycleRoot,
    LifecycleStage,
    LifecycleStatus,
    create_lifecycle,
    LifecycleStateMachineService,
    StageEvidence,
    CorrelationContext,
)

# Create lifecycle aggregate root (Phase-Substage Architecture)
lifecycle = create_lifecycle(
    execution_id="exec-123",
    task_id="task-456",
    project_path="/workspace",
    intent="optimize code"
)

# State transitions (immutable, returns new instance)
lifecycle = lifecycle.transition_to(LifecycleStage.NORMALIZED)
lifecycle = lifecycle.transition_to(LifecycleStage.PLANNED)
```

### Layer Responsibilities

| Layer | Responsibility | Key Constraints |
|-------|---------------|----------------|
| **interfaces** | HTTP interfaces, request routing, context passing, middleware | Forward only, no business logic |
| **application** | Use case orchestration, service coordination, transaction boundaries, composition root | Depends on domain, no infrastructure dependencies |
| **domain** | Domain models, business rules, aggregate roots, value objects, domain services, port definitions | No external dependencies, pure business expression |
| **infrastructure** | Adapter implementations, configuration, persistence, external integrations, observability | Implements domain ports, not exposed to business layers |

## Governance and Validation

### Governance Levels

| Level | Checks Performed | Use Case |
|-------|------------------|----------|
| `minimal` | Basic syntax checks only | Rapid iteration |
| `standard` | Static analysis + architecture checks | Daily development |
| `strict` | All checks + mutation testing | Pre-release validation |

### Built-in Validation Plugins

| Plugin | Functionality | Dependency |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| Architecture | Import layer contract checking | import-linter |
| StaticAnalysis | ruff + mypy static checking | ruff, mypy |
| YAMLValidation | YAML file syntax validation | pyyaml |
| ComposeHint | Docker Compose file checks | PyYAML |
| ADRCheck | Architecture decision record consistency | - |
| MutmutPlugin | Mutation testing (optional) | mutmut |
| PipAuditPlugin | Dependency security scanning (optional) | pip-audit |
